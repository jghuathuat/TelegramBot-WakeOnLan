Description=Telegram Bot for WoL and PC Control
# Ensures network is available before starting
After=network.target network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
# --- Configuration via Environment File ---
# Loads environment variables from the specified file.
# Ensure this file exists, is readable by 'User=', and has correct KEY=VALUE format.
# Make sure the file has secure permissions (e.g., chmod 600).
EnvironmentFile=/opt/TelegramBot-WakeOnLan/.env/bot.conf

# --- Execution ---
# Option 1: If script is executable (chmod +x your_script.py) and has shebang
# ExecStart=/path/to/your/telegram_wol_bot.py
# Option 2: Execute with python3 interpreter explicitly (often safer)
# Make sure the path to your python script is correct.
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/TelegramBot-WakeOnLan/wol-bot.py

# --- Security & Working Directory ---
# Run as a dedicated, non-root user (create this user first: useradd -r -s /bin/false botuser)
User=ansible
Group=ansible
# Set the working directory. Useful if the script needs relative paths (though absolute is preferred).
# This should be a directory the 'User=' has access to.
WorkingDirectory=/opt/TelegramBot-WakeOnLan/

# --- Process Management ---
Restart=on-failure       # Restart the service if the script exits with an error
RestartSec=5s            # Wait 5 seconds before attempting restart
TimeoutStopSec=60s       # Max time (seconds) to wait for the script to stop gracefully
StandardOutput=journal   # Redirect stdout to systemd journal (view with journalctl)
StandardError=journal    # Redirect stderr to systemd journal
