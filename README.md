# TelegramBot-WakeOnLan

## üöÄ Project Overview
This is my Telegram bot that I use to remotely manage Windows PC on my network. It allows me to send Wake-on-LAN (WoL) packets to wake up Windows PC, as well as perform actions like restarting or shutting it down.

## üìã Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- A Telegram bot token (set via environment variable `BOT_TOKEN`)
- Target machine's MAC address and network configuration for WoL

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash

    - `TARGET_NAME`: (Optional) User-friendly name for the target PC. Defaults to "Main PC".
